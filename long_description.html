        <p>Welcome to <i>Correct-the-Classification</i>, ForestWatchers’ latest application! ForestWatchers proposes a new paradigm in deforestation monitoring based on the power of crowdsourcing. As we all know, tropical forests are under increasing threat worldwide. During the last decades, several million hectares of humid tropical forest were lost each year.</p>
        <p><i>Correct-the-Classification</i> aims at testing (and, eventually, improving) several components that are key to the future performance of the ForestWatchers network. It reproduces, at an elementary scale, one of the main steps carried out by remote sensing experts to visually assess the quality of a deforestation map generated by an automatic classification algorithm. Basically, experts compare a small selected area of the original satellite image with the corresponding classification result (please refer to our tutorial here, for more details).</p>
        <p><i>Correct-the-Classification</i>’s final result will be a corrected deforestation map (as of January 2014) for the Awá-Guajá Indigenous Territory, in Brazil. The Awá-Guajá are an endangered indigenous group of people living in the eastern Amazon forests of Brazil. There are approximately 350 members and 100 of them have no contact with the outside world. Their language is in the Tupi–Guaraní family. Originally living in settlements, they adopted a nomadic lifestyle about 1800 to escape incursions by Europeans. During the 19th century, they came under increasing attack by settlers in the region, who cleared most of the forests from their land. From the mid-1980s onward, some Awá moved to government-established settlements, but for the most part they were able to maintain their traditional way of life, living entirely off their forests, in nomadic groups of a few dozen people, with little or no contact with the outside world.</p>
        <p>The Awá-Guajá Indigenous Territory covers approximately 118,000 hectares of Amazon forest in the State of Maranhão. According to Survival International, a human rights organization which campaigns for the rights of indigenous tribal peoples and considers the Awa-Guajá to be the "earth's most threatened tribe", Awa forests are now disappearing faster than in any other Indian area in the Brazilian Amazon<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aw%C3%A1-Guaj%C3%A1_people"><sup>[Source]</sup></a>.</p>
